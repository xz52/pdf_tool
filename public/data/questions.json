      "A": "Frost may prevent the airplane from becoming airborne at normal takeoff speed.",
      "B": "Frost will change the camber of the wing, increasing lift during takeoff.",
      "C": "Frost may cause the airplane to become airborne with a lower angle of attack at a lower indicated airspeed.",
      "D": "Frost reduces drag and increases climb rate."
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Frost can prevent an airplane from becoming airborne at normal takeoff speed."

    "options": {
      "A": "Unstable air containing an excess of condensation nuclei.",
      "B": "Unstable, moist air.",
      "C": "Either stable or unstable air.",
      "D": "Dry stable air."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Cumulonimbus clouds require lifting action, instability, and moisture."

    "question": "What feature is normally associated with the cumulus stage of a thunderstorm?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Roll cloud.",
      "B": "Continuous updraft.",
      "C": "Frequent lightning.",
      "D": "Heavy rain."
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "In the cumulus stage, continuous updrafts cause the cloud to build upwards."
